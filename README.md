# FTH-G: Private, Asset-Backed Gold Program

**1 token = 1 kg vaulted gold. Private, invite-only, proof-of-reserves. Safe by design.**

See `docs/` and `smart-contracts/fth-gold/` for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-command setup for new developers
make setup

# Daily development workflow
make dev          # Format, build, test
make verify       # Comprehensive verification
make deploy-local # Local deployment with Anvil
```

## Overview

The FTH Gold protocol is a sophisticated DeFi system for asset-backed gold tokens where **1 token equals 1 kilogram of vaulted physical gold**. This repository provides a production-ready DeFi protocol with professional-grade build system, comprehensive documentation, and institutional-quality development workflows.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The FTH Gold protocol implements a sophisticated DeFi architecture with multiple layers of security and compliance:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

         ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
