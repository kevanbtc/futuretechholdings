# FTH-G: Private, Asset-Backed Gold Program
1 token = 1 kg vaulted gold. Private, invite-only, proof-of-reserves. Safe by design.
See `docs/` and `smart-contracts/fth-gold/` for details.
This PR transforms the FTH Gold repository from a basic prototype into a production-ready DeFi protocol with professional-grade build system, comprehensive documentation, and institutional-quality development workflows.

Overview
The FTH Gold protocol is a sophisticated DeFi system for asset-backed gold tokens where 1 token equals 1 kilogram of vaulted physical gold. This PR addresses the complete build system and documentation requirements to make the project production-ready.

Key Improvements
🔧 Build System Transformation
Before: Basic GitHub Actions CI with limited functionality
After: Comprehensive build system with 20+ automated commands

# One-command setup for new developers
make setup

# Professional development workflow
make dev          # Format, build, test
make verify       # Comprehensive verification
make deploy-local # Local deployment with Anvil
New Makefile Features:

Automated dependency management (OpenZeppelin, Forge-std)
Development workflows (dev, verify, prod)
Deployment automation (local, testnet, production)
Testing with coverage and gas reporting
Code formatting and linting
Documentation generation
📚 Documentation Overhaul
Before: 4-line README with minimal information
After: 2000+ lines of institutional-grade documentation
