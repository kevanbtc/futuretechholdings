## Economic Model Analysis

### 1. Revenue Streams & Unit Economics

**Primary Revenue Sources**:

| Revenue Stream | Rate | Annual Estimate (100 kg) | Notes |
|---------------|------|-------------------------|-------|
| Entry Fees | Implicit in $20k/kg fixed price | $200k+ premium | Above spot gold pricing |
| Redemption Fees | 1% of NAV | $20k-40k annually | Based on turnover rate |
| Management Fees | Not implemented | $0 | Future revenue opportunity |
| Carry on Appreciation | Not implemented | $0 | Future revenue opportunity |

**Cost Structure**:
- Physical gold storage: ~0.25% annually
- Oracle services: ~$5k annually  
- Compliance operations: ~$50k annually
- Smart contract maintenance: ~$25k annually
- Insurance coverage: ~0.5% annually

**Break-Even Analysis**: ~$500k AUM (25 kg gold backing)

### 2. Token Economics & Monetary Policy

**Supply Mechanics**:
- 1:1 kg backing ratio maintained at all times
- Fixed entry price eliminates speculation during accumulation
- Deflationary pressure through redemption burns
- No inflationary token printing mechanisms

**Code Reference**: `contracts/config/Parameters.sol:8`
```solidity
uint256 public constant FIXED_ISSUE_PRICE_USD_PER_KG = 20_000e6; // $20k/kg
```

**Demand Drivers**:
- 10% monthly distribution yield attracts income-focused investors
- Gold exposure without physical custody burden
- Multi-chain accessibility via ETH payment rails
- Regulatory compliance reduces institutional barriers

**Price Stability Mechanisms**:
- NAV-based redemptions provide price floor
- Daily redemption limits prevent bank runs
- Coverage ratio requirements maintain backing integrity
- Oracle circuit breakers prevent manipulation

### 3. Yield Distribution Sustainability

**Distribution Policy**: 10% monthly on invested capital

**Funding Sources Analysis**:
- **Gold Appreciation**: Historical 3-8% annually (insufficient alone)
- **Gold Lending**: 1-3% annually in institutional markets
- **Treasury Operations**: High-grade fixed income (4-6% currently)
- **Options Strategies**: Covered calls on gold positions (2-4% annually)

**Sustainability Verdict**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES ACTIVE MANAGEMENT**

The 10% monthly (120% annually) distribution rate significantly exceeds passive gold returns. The deficit accounting mechanism provides crucial protection against unsustainable promises.

**Code Reference**: `contracts/yield/DistributionManager.sol:45-50`
```solidity
if (available >= owed) {
    USDT.transfer(user, owed);
    emit DistributionPaid(user, owed, 0);
} else {
    s.deficit += uint128(owed - available);
    if (available > 0) USDT.transfer(user, available);
    emit DistributionPaid(user, available, owed - available);
}
```
